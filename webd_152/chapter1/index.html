      My favorite drink is a mocha from Starbucks. Not just a normal mocha
      though, I have to be difficult and make it a “tall hot mocha with oat
      milk, an extra shot of espresso, no whip”. I will say the mocha tastes way
      better when you get it with the normal whole fat milk and whipped cream,
      but these Starbucks drinks have a crazy amount of sugar and the best way
      I’ve found to make this a somewhat low fat/low sugar drink is to get the
      smallest size possible (because they add less mocha sauce than the larger
      sizes) and then add extra espresso, replace the milk with oat milk (no fat
      and much less sugar than whole milk) and remove the whipped cream. Thank
      you for coming to my Ted Talk.

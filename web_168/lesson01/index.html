<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Haylee Graham and I am 26 years old. I currently work full time as a Senior Audio Visual Technician at Jamul Casino, and I am also a full time student. I grew up in San Diego but I have also lived in Connecticut and Colorado. I currently live in San Diego with my boyfriend of 3 years. He is a full stack software developer, and is one of my inspirations for taking this class. 
</p>


<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I have 10+ years of experience as an Audio Engineer, working in theater, conference, corporate, concert, and small venue settings. As an Audio Visual Technician, I have worked with video systems (cameras, switchers, playback), LED video wall displays, lights and lighting consoles, and Crestron systems. I also have experience using Dante networking systems and AV over IP knowledge. I just started learning to code this year, starting with the Beginning HTML & CSS class, and I am eager to learn more!
</p>

<h2>Why Am I Taking This Course?</h2>
<p>I am taking this course to enhance my HTML and CSS skills, and learn more about the web development industry. I am considering going in a different direction with my career, possibly something more on the web development side, and I want to see if this would potentially be a good fit for me.</p>

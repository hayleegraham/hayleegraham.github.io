Const is used to assign a constant value to the variable. And the value cannot be changed. Its fixed.
<script>
const a = 50;
a = 60; // shows error. You cannot change the value of const.
const b = "Constant variable";
b = "Assigning new value"; // shows error.
</script>
<script>
const LANGUAGES = ['Js', 'Ruby', 'Python', 'Go'];
LANGUAGES = "Javascript"; // shows error. 
LANGUAGES.push('Java'); // Works fine.
console.log(LANGUAGES); // ['Js', 'Ruby', 'Python', 'Go', 'Java']
</script>
Whenever you define a const variable, Javascript references the address of the value to the variable. In our example the variable ‘LANGUAGES’ actually references to the memory allocated to the array. So you cannot change the variable to reference some other memory location later. Throughout the program it only references to the array.

for..of is very similar to for..in with slight modification.
for..of iterates through list of elements (i.e) like Array and returns the elements (not their index) one by one.
<script>
	let arr = [2,3,4,1];
for (let value of arr) {
 console.log(value);
}
</script>
Note that the variable ‘value’ outputs each element in the array not the index.
<script>
	let string = "Javascript";
for (let char of string) {
 console.log(char);
}
</script>
